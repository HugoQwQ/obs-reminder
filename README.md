3. Paste it into the Browser Source URL field
4. Set width: `265`, height: `85` (or adjust as needed)

4. Click **Stop** anytime to pause

## Configuration

Settings are saved in `config.toml` in the same directory. You can also edit it directly:

```toml
[app]
version = "0.0.1"

[toaster]
titles = ["bbb", "114514", "alright"]
contents = ["im content", "hoho", "what can i say?"]
interval_time = 30  # minutes
duration = 5        # seconds
color_1 = "#FF6B6B"
color_2 = "#4ECDC4"
text_color = "#FFFFFF"
content_switch_mode = "random"  # or "sequential"
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture

* **Desktop App**: Rust + egui for UI
* **Web Server**: Embedded HTTP server using hyper-rs
* **Browser Component**: Svelte + svelte-toast for notifications
* **Communication**: WebSocket for real-time messages

### Ports

* **HTTP Server**: `localhost:8080` (for OBS browser source)
* **WebSocket**: `localhost:7981` (internal communication)

### System Requirements

* Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
* OBS Studio 28.0+ (supports browser source)
* Available ports 8080 and 7981

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

* Latest Rust
* Node.js 22+ and pnpm (or other package manager)
* Git

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Toast not showing in OBS:**

* Verify browser source URL is `http://localhost:8080`
* Ensure desktop app is running
* Try refreshing the browser source
* Make sure Windows Firewall is not blocking the app

**Connection issues:**

* Ensure ports 8080 and 7981 are available
* Check Windows Defender/antivirus settings
* Try running as administrator if needed

**Performance issues:**

* Reduce toast display duration if there is lag
* Ensure OBS hardware acceleration is enabled
* Close unnecessary applications
